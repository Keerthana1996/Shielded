# Shielded: Smart Personal Safety Device
Our proposed system called Shielded is a real-time, quick responding, reliable device that consists of advanced sensors that monitors physiological signs in real time. The basic idea underlying shielded is to send a notification giving instant location and other essential details of the distressed victim to the people nearby rather than to emergency contacts who may be miles away so that the necessary help can be provided as fast as possible and so that such unfortunate incidents could be averted.
